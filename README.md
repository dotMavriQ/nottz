## Raison d'être
I've been using a [popular theme for my Hugo blog](https://github.com/pacollins/hugo-future-imperfect-slim) that had some quirky markdown front matter for posts. 

I worked on my fork until I realized 
that a lot of the stuff I was toiling to sort in my fork had been 
properly addressed and improved upon in the original. 

…This was written in a matter of minutes by a very good friend of mine.
Thanks Functie, I'll credit you if you feel like it's appropriate!
